        </h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to allow people to upload cell images from a blood smear. The image should contain
            one cell other than erythrocytes in question for analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The machine learning program was created using TensorFlow with training and validation images from: 
            <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/1"> A dataset for microscopic peripheral blood cell images for development of automatic recognition systems</a>
